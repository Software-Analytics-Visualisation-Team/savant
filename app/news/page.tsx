This unique event aims to highlight the transformative potential of software engineering to address pressing challenges and foster innovation in the Global South.

Out of many impressive submissions, 13 exceptional papers have been accepted, representing thought-provoking work from authors in Australia, Papua New Guinea, Botswana, Indonesia, Tanzania, Uganda, UAE and the USA. These contributions span a diverse range of topics from insights on IoT, Generative AI (GenAI), to the development and application of safety-critical systems in resource-constrained settings, underscoring the exciting intersections between cutting-edge technology and practical problem-solving.

We invite you to join us in this vibrant conversation about the future of software engineering and its role in driving positive change. More information about the symposium can be found on the ICSE website below:`,
