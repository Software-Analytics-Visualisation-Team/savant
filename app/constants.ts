  'Our Deductive Software Architecture Reconstruction approach leverages Large Language Models (LLMs). In contrast to classical SAR techniques (bottom-up), our deductive approach defines architectural component characteristics and identifies evidence within the source code (top-down). LLMs enhance this generic capability. Our proof-of-concept, using GPT-4, demonstrates deductive reasoning by applying it to the Android app K-9 Mail, achieving 70% accuracy in classifying 54 classes and 184 methods.';
