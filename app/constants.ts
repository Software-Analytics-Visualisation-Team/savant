In contrast to classical SAR techniques (bottom-up), our deductive approach defines architectural component characteristics and identifies evidence within the source code (top-down). LLMs enhance this generic capability. Our proof-of-concept, using GPT-4, demonstrates deductive reasoning by applying it to the Android app K-9 Mail, achieving 70% accuracy in classifying 54 classes and 184 methods.';

Developing such systems faces several challenges: complexity, scale, and legacy evolution. The key approach is architecture, which provides a high-level representation of the system, illustrating how its hierarchically decomposed into subsystems and how these subsystems interact. The ultimate goal in this project is to create automated tools that maintain consistency between the architecture and the implementation.';
